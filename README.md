# KNN-Classifier
In this one, I have used KNN as the classifier on the malware dataset to classify the malware type. After the data preprocessing, I took different parameters comprising different distances like Eucledian, manhattan, and cosine. I saw accuracies decreasing from 99 to 89 for all the distances which is a sign for reducing overfitting.
