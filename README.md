# KNN-Classifier
In this one I have used KNN as the classifier on the malware dataset to classify the malware type. After the data preprocessing I have taken diffrent paramaters comprising of different distances like eucledian, manhattan, cosine and we see accuracies decreasing from 99 to 89 for all the distances which is a sign for reducing overfitting.
